                    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                    <h2><b>Lucky Phukuntsi Khabe</b>, a BSc Information Technology student at the North-West University [Vanderbijlpark Campus].</h2>
                    <p> I am an aspiring Systems Developer/Computer Scientist. His highest academic achievement thus far is being invited to be a Golden Key member. Lucky is a natural leader at
                        heart and he currently serves as the chairperson of Every Nation Campus (ENC) student society.
                        Lucky has reasonable experience in the science and engineering fields as that was once the career he was pursuing at the beginning of his
                        tertiary life. His science and engineering knowledge has enabled him to have internships that would further his knowledge and enable him
                        to broaden his horizons. Being a part of various projects during his internships has aided his personal development.</p><br>
                        <p>In 2018 Lucky decided to pursue a career in IT this was after a few gap years he had taken to rediscover himself. Since we are in the 4th
                            Industrial Revolution Lucky figured that pursuing a career in IT would be a good way to contribute to the society. His passion for computers
                            and the science behind them and how they operate entices him. The ultimate goal for Lucky is to be a computer scientist and to give back
                            to his surrounding community by having science centers where people can learn and up-skill themselves. He is very passionate about
                            community development and would like to see life improve in the townships. He believes that science and technology are to play a huge
                            part in the development of our communities and we must use them to our advantage.</p><br>
                            <p>There has been a lot of challenges in his life but they have only been stepping stones to his purpose. His purpose involves people and
                                serving them to that best of his abilities and using technology to do just that, hence the chosen career path. He decided that he will
                                incorporate his science and engineering knowledge with his technological knowledge to solve various problems but first he must obtain
                                his BSc IT degree. This degree would open a lot of doors for him to fulfill his dreams.</p>
